# PFS Workspace

This repository serves as my workspace for achieving economic objectives within the Post Fiat System (PFS). It contains my planning documentation, progress tracking, and task completion records.

## Economic Objectives

My primary objective is to achieve economic freedom through sustainable passive income by leveraging the Post Fiat System's rewards, task submission opportunities, and financial tools.

### Key Goals

1. **Build a Steady Passive Income Stream**
   - Target: 27,000 PFT monthly (3 months)
   - Scale to: 40,500 PFT monthly (12 months)
   - Focus: Task participation and automation

2. **Create System Value**
   - Submit 3 high-quality proposals (6 months)
   - Support 5+ users monthly with onboarding/issues
   - Develop collaborative community projects

3. **Establish Long-Term Wealth Growth**
   - Stake 50% of monthly PFT earnings
   - Build 300,000 PFT reserves (18 months)
   - Transition to automated passive income
